# Welcome to your organization's demo No worries at all—we’ll check it together! Here's how to confirm if you did it right:


---

How to Check:

1. Go to your GitHub repo:
https://github.com/Silva-Clearmind/demo-repository


2. Scroll to the top of the page.
Do you see a "View on GitHub" badge under the repo title in the README area?




---

If you don’t see the badge:

Double-check that the code below is exactly what you put into your README.md:

[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/View_on-GitHub-181717?logo=github)](https://github.com/Silva-Clearmind/demo-repository)

If you’d like, paste your current README.md contents here, and I’ll review it to make sure it’s set up right.

Or just tell me what you see on your repo page, and I’ll guide you from there!


This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.
